                <h1>Game of Thrones season 6 episode 6: Brace yourselves for a surprise return</h1>
                <div class="para">Each episode of Game of Thrones season six has dished out one huge reveal indicating that showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are gearing their HBO series up for a close.

                With a rumoured two seasons left to go, it's certain fans can expect a whole lot more too over the remainder of the current season.

                While the recently announced title of episode seven - "The Broken Man" - hinted at the surprise return of an old familiar, it seems that we may, in fact, be seeing the shock comeback as soon as the show's next episode "Blood of My Blood".

                Beforehand, cast your minds back to words spoken by Ian McShane - who is set to guest star - to Radio 5Live.

                Describing his character, he said:  "[He] is like a former warrior who has renounced violence and now leads this peace cult. I have nursed a loved character, a much-loved character back to life. And he reintroduces - I wont say him or her - but it's a character whose much-loved who everyone thinks is dead. But he's not dead."

                Now look at the episode's synopsis.

                "An old foe comes back into the picture. Gilly (Hannah Murray) meets Sam's (John Bradley) family. Arya (Maisie Williams) faces a difficult choice. Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) faces off against the High Sparrow (Jonathan Pryce).""

                Surveying the evidence, it would not be a stretch to assume the "much-loved character" mentioned by McShane could also be the "old foe" alluded to in the synopsis above. Many believe this character to be Sandor Clegane himself, the Hound (Rory McCann) who was left for dead by Arya after a battle with Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) in season four.

                If this is the case, prepare to be reunited with the character this weekend.

                Elsewhere, it seems Benjen Stark may finally be showing up again to rescue Bran and Meera from the horde of white walkers hot on their heels.</div>
                <h1>Season 6 Episode 5 "Hold the door" - Hodor scene explained</h1>
                <div class="para">What's going on at the start of this sequence is Bran and the Raven are again visiting Winterfell decades earlier via a time travel "dream" and we see Bran's grandfather Rickard giving a young Ned Stark a pep talk before sending him away. Also present is a young Wyllis, who we know better as Hodor. Back at this time Hodor is a normal boy who can say many things other than "Hodor".

                Meanwhile, the Night's King and several other White Walkers have brought an army of undead to the Three-Eyed Raven's cave. The Children of the Forest attempt to hold them off outside with magic grenades and a barrier of fire, but it doesn't accomplish much aside from briefly stalling their progress.

                This mass of bad guys manages to get into the cave, while Bran and the Raven are still having their time-travel dream. Hodor, as he's wont to do in dangerous situations, sits in the corner holding himself saying "Hodor" over and over again.

                Meera and the Children fight the undead, but they need to flee or else they'll be slaughtered. So Meera screams at Bran that they need Hodor, and Bran wargs into him, taking control as he'd done a few times in the past. However, Bran doesn't leave the dream. He multitasks it.

                So Hodor, controlled by Bran, escapes from the cave with Bran and Meera, but the tide of undead requires that Hodor personally bar the door to the cave while Meera drags Bran away. Meera yells, "Hold the door!" at Hodor repeatedly - and with Bran still in the dream, Meera's command is passing into the past. The young Hodor hears it.

                Because of the weird time bridge that is Bran connecting the younger and the present-day Hodor, the younger version goes into a seizure and begins repeating, "hold the door", over and over again, eventually mashing the phrase together into "Hodor".</div>
